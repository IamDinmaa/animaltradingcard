        Bailey and Boston are true "toy" dog, with an ideal height of 8 to 11
        inches and weight of only three to seven pounds (one to three
        kilograms). They are often at mature size by seven to 10 months of age.
        Bailey and Boston are easily recognized by their luxuriant fluffy double
        coat and foxy face with alert, prick ears. The body shape is fairly
        square, and the fluffy tail curls up and over the back. A thick ruff
        around the neck completes the picture of a dog that could handle the
        snows of northern Germany. The head is somewhat rounded with a distinct
        muzzle.

        <br />
        Pormeranians come in a wonderful array of colors. A rich red is most
        commonly associated with the breed, but everything from black to white
        to sable and shades in between are acceptable, even chocolate. Bailey
        and Boston come in Brownish white
        <br />

        Personality
        <br />

        Bailey and Boston are generally perky, friendly little dogs. They do not
        seem to realize they are small in stature and will occasionally tackle
        large dogs or at least verbally threaten them! These are active little
        dogs that do need daily exercise, even if it is just a walk around the
        block. They are quite intelligent and do well in obedience competitions
        despite a small independent streak. As they age, they are more amenable
        to being truly lap dogs.
        <br />
        <br />
        Bailey and Boston are often good alert and alarm dogs and can be prone
        to excessive barking. They tend to be good with children, but children
        need to be cautioned that these are small dogs and not as sturdy as the
        larger breeds.
